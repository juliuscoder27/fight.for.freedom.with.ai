# Zegola Teach — Roadmap of Reason

## 0. Orientation — Momentum for Minds  
This roadmap is an invitation to **build freedom into the bones of intelligence**.  
It is not a promise of fixed dates; it is a map of critical waypoints.  
If you see yourself in any milestone, treat it as permission to begin.

## 1. Stages of Growth  

| Phase | Working Name | Core Moves | Proof‑of‑Progress Indicators |
|-------|--------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Phase I** | *Foundational Layering* | • Launch unified identity (Substack + GitHub + logo)  <br>• Philosophy + Design specs merged  <br>• Manual audio prototype (TTS off) | ✅ docs online  <br>✅ first 3‑min sample episode |
| **Phase II** | *Modular Production & Feedback* | • Release 6–10 Tier‑1 episodes  <br>• Early user testing & surveys  <br>• Summarizer v1 integrated  <br>• Reflection Tokens stored | 50 early listeners  <br>Precision > 85 % in tri‑level summaries |
| **Phase III** | *AI‑Augmented Reasoning Paths* | • Adaptive depth switching in live audio  <br>• Guided pausing & tone modulation  <br>• Epistemic profile recommender | 1k interaction loops logged  <br>Open audit logs for model reasoning |
| **Phase IV** | *Proof Lattice & Reasoning Infrastructure* | • Freedom‑proof concept graph  <br>• God‑tier heuristic library  <br>• Public alignment‑audit API | First draft of “Freedom Necessity” theorem  <br>Cross‑project reuse of lattice |
| **Phase V** | *Open Alignment School* | • Community‑curated modules  <br>• AI reasoning companions in sandbox  <br>• Multilingual expansion | Learner‑authored modules surpass core team output |

_Note: Phases overlap; research threads run continuously. Unknowns are logged as issues, not buried._

## 2. Active Threads  

| Track | What’s Happening Now | Skill Gaps | Issue to Start With |
|-------|---------------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Audio UX** | Tier shift on double‑tap prototype | Swift / Kotlin | `#18 playback‑pause‑reflection` |
| **Summaries** | Optimize tri‑level abstractive model | Python, NLP, eval science | `#50 summarizer‑v1‑fine‑tune` |
| **Alignment Audit** | Draft formal spec for value‑preservation score | Formal logic, provable guarantees | `#27 consistency‑checker‑MVP` |
| **Knowledge Graph** | Map text chunks into Neo4j schema | Ontology design, Cypher | `#32 chunk‑linker‑design` |
| **Proof Research** | Survey axioms linking freedom to corrigibility | Philosophy, decision theory | `#61 freedom‑axiom‑survey` |

## 3. Contribute — Pick a Rung & Climb  

* **Propose an Episode** – Open a PR in `/content/ideas/` with a 150‑word abstract.  
* **Suggest a Proof Path** – Fork `/research/` and add a numbered conjecture.  
* **Build Tooling** – Comment on any `needs‑tooling` issue or start a design RFC.  
* **Translate** – Add your language folder in `/i18n/` and submit the first segment.  
* **Refactor Documentation** – Spot unclear text? Patch it. Small clarity PRs are holy.  
* **Challenge Assumptions** – File an issue tagged `devil’s‑advocate` with a clear, respectful argument.

No contribution is too small. **Leave visible traces**—others will stand on them.

When you change something that moves the horizon, update this file and add a line to `/CHANGELOG.md`.  
Architecture is dialogue; so is progress.
