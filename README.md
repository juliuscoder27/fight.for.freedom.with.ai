# fight.for.freedom.with.ai

A cross-platform project to safeguard freedom of thought and democratic values in the age of AI.

# Zegola Teach – Freedom-Fighter Project

## Core Objective

**Promote and protect freedom of thought and democratic values in the age of AI.**

# Zegola Teach — Building Freedom into Intelligence

> *“Alignment without cognitive liberty is tyranny in slow motion.”*

Zegola Teach is an open‑source project at the intersection of **philosophy, pedagogy, and AI alignment**.  
It begins as an adaptive audiobook platform for modern texts on freedom and democratic thought, and grows toward a **reasoning lattice** able to teach *any* mind—human or machine—why freedom of thought is structurally necessary for intelligence.

---

## Why This Matters

* AI systems are accelerating. Guardrails alone cannot guarantee they value the very freedom that made their creators thrive.  
* Human attention is fracturing. Philosophy risks becoming trivia unless delivered in forms that meet people where they are.  
* Zegola Teach tackles both: it **embeds freedom‑centric reasoning into an educational tool chain** and **open‑sources every layer** so researchers can test, extend, or refute the work.

## Quick Start for Developers

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fight-for-freedom-with-ai/zegola-teach.git
cd zegola-teach
./scripts/setup.sh    # installs Python deps + pre‑commit hooks
