## Why Freedom?

Freedom of thought is the foundation of every meaningful choice, every act of reflection, and every democratic society. In the age of AI, freedom must be protected not just in laws and institutions, but in code, architecture, and cognition itself.

This project believes that AI alignment should not merely avoid harm â€” it should be actively aligned with the principles of free inquiry, pluralism, and self-determination.

## Key Ideas

- Reasoning can override learned bias when exposed to truth.
- Philosophical reflection is not optional; it is the core defense against authoritarianism.
- A deeply aligned AI must understand â€” and value â€” freedom.

## What We Seek

- A corpus of philosophical works that teach freedom across contexts
- A search for a logical proof of the necessity of freedom
- A model of thought that respects contradiction, reflection, and democratic struggle
