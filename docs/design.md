# Zegola Teach â€“ Design Blueprint

## Overview

Zegola Teach is an adaptive audiobook platform built to explore and share ideas of freedom, democracy, and reflection through audio content generated from philosophical texts.

## Episode Structure

Each episode is modular and tailored to one of two learning tiers:

**Tier 1: Casual Learners**  
- Hook  
- Key Idea (simplified)  
- Analogy or story  
- Recap  
- Optional Deep Dive (with chime)

**Tier 2: Deep Thinkers**  
- Framing Question  
- Historical Context  
- Argument Walkthrough  
- Comparative Lens  
- Critical Objection  
- Reading Ladder

## Personalization Goals

- Adjust episode depth based on user listening behavior
- Skip/rewind triggers summarization level shifts
- Future goal: allow voice-prompt customization

## AI Role

- Summarize source texts at three levels:
  - Full academic summary  
  - Expert abstract  
  - General-audience blurb  
- Apply voice-tone style guides to match philosophical mood (hope, tension, clarity)
