# Open Questions

These are unresolved philosophical and technical challenges related to the Zegola Teach initiative.

We invite collaborators to add their own open questions—either through discussion or by submitting a pull request to this file.

## Foundational Questions

- What minimal logical axioms make cognitive liberty a necessary condition for convergent instrumental reasoning?
- How might “freedom of thought” be formalised so that it becomes measurable in machine architectures?
- Can reasoning structures be built to detect and override biased training without hard-coded rules?
- What governance models keep a pluralistic codebase coherent without gatekeeping novel ideas?
- Which epistemic security measures protect free inquiry from coordinated disinformation?

## Pedagogy & Alignment

- What pedagogical approaches allow an AI to internalise values without blind obedience?
- Can “moral curiosity” be nurtured within large language models through interaction?
- How do we design AI tutors that guide without prescribing—mirroring Socratic method or dialogic learning?

## Cognitive Structures & Proofs

- Can a fixed formal theorem coexist with systems that must adapt in real time?
- How might recursive self-reflection be formally defined and embedded?
- Is there a formal way to demonstrate that intelligence requires freedom from fixed priors?
