# Zegola Teach — Design Blueprint for Cognitive-Liberty Learning

## 0. Framing Vision  
*Infrastructure in service of interior freedom*

Zegola Teach begins as an adaptive audiobook platform, but its true horizon is wider: a **recursive learning lattice** where humans and machines co‑practice the arts of reflection, self‑revision, and democratic dialogue. This document translates that ambition into an architecture you can build against.

## 1. System Shape  

A layered system—simple to grasp, expandable by design.

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Presentation Layer (Audio + Voice)  │
├───────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Pedagogy Engine                     │
│  • Tier Selector                     │
│  • Reflective Pausing / Prompts      │
├───────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Content Graph                       │
│  • Text Chunks (philosophy corpus)   │
│  • Commentary & Analogies            │
│  • Alignment Tags (values, logic)    │
├───────────────────────────────────────┤
│  AI Reasoning Services               │
│  • Multi‑level Summaries             │
│  • Tone & Voice Modulation           │
│  • Alignment Audits                  │
├───────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Data & Memory Layer                 │
│  • Listener Interaction Logs         │
│  • Reflection Tokens (insights)      │
└───────────────────────────────────────┘
```

*Each layer is modular; you can swap a TTS engine or a summarizer without rewriting pedagogy logic.*

## 2. Content Structure  

**Two Tiers, One Text**

| Tier | Audience Mode | Episode Flow | Goal |
|------|---------------|--------------|------|
| **Casual (Tier 1)** | Commuter, walking, background | Hook → Key Idea → Story/Analogy → Recap | Seed curiosity; zero friction |
| **Committed (Tier 2)** | Notebook‑in‑hand learner | Framing Question → Historical Context → Argument Walkthrough → Comparative Lens → Critical Objection → Reading Ladder | Deep conceptual transfer |

*Both tiers pull from the same canonical chunk list; only the scaffold differs.*

---

## 3. Personalization Logic  

1. **Adaptive Depth** – Playback behaviors (skip, replay, pause) trigger real‑time tier shifting.  
2. **Reflective Pauses** – Optional chimes invite the listener to articulate a thought; speech‑to‑text stores “Reflection Tokens.”  
3. **Mood Modes** – User can say *“Explain like a debate coach”* or *“Set a contemplative tone”*; DJ‑style transitions adjust voice, pacing, and ambient sound.  
4. **Curiosity Mapping** – Interaction patterns are abstracted into epistemic profiles (e.g., skeptic, synthesizer) to suggest next texts without trapping anyone in a bubble.

---

## 4. AI Involvement  

* **Tri‑Level Summaries** – Full academic, expert abstract, general blurb.  
* **Analogy Generator** – Maps philosophical constructs onto everyday domains (gardening, jazz, open‑source culture).  
* **Tone Matcher** – Selects prosody and lexical style aligned with text mood (Socratic tension, Stoic calm).  
* **Alignment Audit** – Every generated segment is scored for logical consistency, value preservation, and freedom‑compatibility. Audit metadata stays inspectable.  

> **Design Principle:** Generation pipelines must expose their reasoning steps; opacity is debt.

## 5. Long‑Term Implications  

Zegola Teach is a **reasoning ladder**: each rung—text chunk, summary, reflection—forms a traceable argument chain. Feed that chain back into research and you get data for a future proof that *cognitive liberty is a structural necessity for robust intelligence.* In practice:

* **Seed‑Structures** – Episode graphs double as lightweight knowledge ontologies.  
* **Reflective Paths** – Stored Reflection Tokens can train metacognition modules.  
* **Memory Embedding** – Listener insights (opt‑in, anonymised) become a corpus for studying freedom‑aligned cognition.

## 6. Current Progress & Invitation  

### What Works Today  
* Prototype TTS pipeline with dynamic tier switching.  
* 30 curated texts chunked and tagged with preliminary alignment metadata.  
* Summarizer v0 (3 levels) with accuracy benchmarks.  

### What Needs You  
| Track | Skill Needs | First Issues |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Audio UX** | Swift / Kotlin, spatial audio | `#18 Playback‑pause‑reflection` |
| **Alignment Audits** | Python, formal logic | `#27 Consistency‑checker MVP` |
| **Knowledge Graph** | Neo4j, ontology design | `#32 Chunk‑linker design` |

Pull requests and critical commentary are welcome. Start anywhere, but start visibly—others will follow the trace you leave.

*This blueprint evolves with every commit. When you improve a component, update the diagram and leave a reasoning note. Architecture is dialogue.*
